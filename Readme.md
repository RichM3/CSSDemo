# CSS Demos

## Background and Overview

I am very interested in developing my CSS skills after developing a previous project.  I enjoy learning and developing frontend features and other aspects specific to the CSS and JS realm.
This project would allow me to enhance my current skillset and share my new found skills with the world.  Below are 7 aspects of CSS coding that I want to learn and master over the next week.

## Functionality and MVP Features

CSS Demos will provide the user with examples of:

1) Recolor a card or toggle visibility
2) A semantic button is used within a card component
3) Weaving One Element Over and Under Another Element
4) Flipping a card in CSS
5) Rotate card
6) Mouseover - Effects
7) Resizing images based on cooresponding text sizes
8) Typewriter Effects
9) Text Effects

 
### Wireframes
    The app will consist of a single page with the above demos listed with anchor tags at the top to each corresponding section.  The page top will additionally include links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and personel profile pages.
    The rest of the page will provide the CSS Demo listed with backgrounds alternating to differentiate each section.  This visual variation is a design decision to provide a visable differnece to the user letting them know we have reached a new section.
